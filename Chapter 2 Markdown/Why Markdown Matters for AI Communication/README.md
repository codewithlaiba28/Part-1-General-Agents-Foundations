**Why Markdown Matters for AI Communication - Notes:**

**Problem with Unstructured Text:**
- AI must guess features, order, priorities
- Messy, ambiguous requirements

**Solution: Markdown = Structured Text**
- Humans can read easily
- Computers can parse perfectly
- Clear labels for both humans & AI

**Why Use Markdown Everywhere:**
- No special software needed
- AI can parse structure
- Renders beautifully
- Stable (since 2004)

**Markdown Flavors:**
- CommonMark = base standard
- GFM (GitHub Flavored) = adds tables, tasks, strikethrough

**Structured vs Unstructured:**
- Unstructured = AI guesses
- Structured = Clear labels, no ambiguity

**AIDD Three Layers (Markdown = Layer 1):**
1. **Intent Layer (YOU)**: Write spec in Markdown
2. **Reasoning Layer (AI)**: Plans implementation
3. **Implementation Layer (AI)**: Generates code

**Key Point:** 
Markdown spec = Bridge between intent & code

**Real-World Uses:**
1. GitHub README files
2. AI specifications
3. Documentation sites
4. AI chat prompts

**Verification Framework (Critical):**
1. Check against what you know
2. Ask AI to explain reasoning
3. Test specific claims
4. Cross-reference when unsure

**Bottom Line:**
- AI is thinking partner, NOT authority
- Always verify AI responses
- Build your own judgment
