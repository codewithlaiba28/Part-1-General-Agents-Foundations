**The Origin Story (Sept 2024)**
- Boris Cherny gave Claude filesystem access
- Claude naturally explored, read files, followed imports
- "Product Overhang" - capability existed, just needed access
- Model didn't need to get smarter, needed to see actual code

**Internal Adoption Results**
- 20% adoption day one → 50% day five → 80%+ by May 2025
- 5 PRs/day vs 1-2 typical
- 67% PR throughput increase
- $500M ARR by mid-2025 → $1B by Nov 2025
- Mostly word-of-mouth growth

**Paradigm Shift: Passive vs Agentic**

**Passive AI (ChatGPT):**
- Consultant on phone (can't see screen)
- You describe code
- Generic advice
- Copy-paste-adapt-test-fail-repeat

**Agentic AI (Claude Code):**
- Pair programmer (sees your code)
- Reads files, understands patterns
- Proposes specific changes
- Runs tests, sees errors, iterates

**General vs Custom Agents**
- **General Agent** = senior consultant, handles anything, instant setup
- **Custom Agent** = factory machine, one specific task, weeks to build
- Use General Agents to BUILD Custom Agents

**OODA Loop (How Agents Think)**
- Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → Correct
- Loops until solved
- Tests work, fixes mistakes in real-time

**Agent Skills**
- SKILL.md files = encoded expertise
- Domain knowledge as intellectual property
- Can be sold as products

**The Stat:**
90% of Claude Code written by Claude Code itself

**Cowork (Jan 2026)**
- Same agent architecture as Claude Code
- Desktop GUI instead of terminal
- Target: Knowledge workers vs Developers
- Same foundation: Claude Agent SDK

**Bottom Line:**
Access > Intelligence. The capability was always there, it just needed permission to see and act on actual files.
