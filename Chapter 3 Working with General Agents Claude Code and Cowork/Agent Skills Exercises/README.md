# Agent Skills Exercises

## THE 6-STEP FRAMEWORK (MEMORIZE)

1. **DEFINE** — What problem?
2. **DRAFT** — Write SKILL.md
3. **TEST** — Run examples + edge cases
4. **EVALUATE** — Score output
5. **IMPROVE** — Fix issues
6. **REPEAT** — Until consistent

---

## ASSESSMENT RUBRIC (24 POINTS MAX)

**6 Criteria** (1-4 points each):
1. Trigger Description
2. Instructions
3. Examples
4. Edge Case Handling
5. Testing
6. Iteration

**Production-ready:** 18+ points  
**Needs work:** Below 12 points

---

## 4-CRITERIA: WHEN TO BUILD A SKILL

1. Is it **repeatable**?
2. Needs **consistent output**?
3. Can I write **clear rules**?
4. Requires **background context**?

**3-4 YES → BUILD SKILL**  
**1-2 YES → JUST PROMPT**

## 8 MODULES (QUICK REFERENCE)

| Module | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| **1** | Understanding skills (read SKILL.md) |
| **2** | First skills (email, files, data) |
| **3** | Add examples (rules + examples = better) |
| **4** | Add references (brand guides, policies) |
| **5** | Test & iterate (break → fix → measure) |
| **6** | Compose skills (pipelines, libraries) |
| **7** | Production skills (real business needs) |
| **8** | Capstones (complete skill suites) |

---

## CRITICAL PATTERNS

**Examples > Rules**
- Rules only = moderate consistency
- Rules + Examples = high consistency  
- Rules + Examples + Anti-examples = highest consistency

**Pipeline Pattern**
- Input → Skill 1 → Skill 2 → Skill 3 → Output
- Each skill's output = next skill's input

**Edge Case Workflow**
- Break → Document → Fix → Verify

**Measure Improvement**
- Same inputs + same rubric + only skill changes = controlled test

---

## PRODUCTION-READY CHECKLIST

✅ Complete (all sections)  
✅ Tested (2+ cases, edge cases handled)  
✅ Documented (README)  
✅ Usable by others (no explanation needed)  
✅ Scores 18+ on rubric

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

❌ No edge case testing  
❌ No examples (rules alone)  
❌ Not testing with others  
❌ Vague quality criteria  
❌ Building isolated skills (miss pipelines)

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**Skills = reusable instruction files for consistent AI output**

**Framework:** 6 steps (DEFINE → REPEAT)

**Quality:** Rubric score 18+ = production-ready

**Power:** Examples constrain better than rules; skills that chain = workflows

**Goal:** Build skills that solve YOUR real problems
